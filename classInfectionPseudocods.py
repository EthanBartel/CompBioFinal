class Infection

#This will be our base class for different methods of infection
#It will include with inherit resistance rate

#viruses- fastest evolving, more affected by environment, bonus to infectivity
#bacteria- medium evol., normally affected by environ., bonus to drug resistance
#parasites- slow evoluntion, least affected by environ, low visibilty


#Each type of infection will have it's own transmission rate

#select for transmisttion
#rodent-rats, mice, squirrels, and other rodents 
#insect- mosquitos and other blood-sucking insects
#waterborne-spread through water>can infect water facilities, requires moisture)
#airborne- allows virus to spread though air

#It will include their interactions with the environment (mode of transmission, drug interaction, etc.)
#Viruses will be the most virulent, then bacteria, then parasites
